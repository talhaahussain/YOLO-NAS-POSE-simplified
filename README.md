# YOLO-NAS-POSE-simplified

A simpler (and working) notebook and repo for convinient use of YOLO-NAS-POSE, a human pose estimation model by Deci AI. Aims to run in a less resource intensive manner, by eliminating real-time capture and playback, and instead reading from and writing to permanent image and video files.

### Usage
